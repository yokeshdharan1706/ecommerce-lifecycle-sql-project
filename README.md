# 📊 E-commerce Product Lifecycle & ROI Forecasting (SQL Project)

This project leverages SQL to analyze the lifecycle and profitability of products in an e-commerce or rental-based business model.

### 🔍 Objectives:
- Forecast return on investment (ROI) per product
- Compare rental revenue against procurement cost
- Tag underperforming and high-performing products
- Analyze rental frequency before product retirement
- Track product discount strategies and their impact

### 📁 Dataset:
Loaded from an Excel/CSV file containing:
- Product names, categories, prices (actual and discounted)
- Ratings, number of reviews, product images and links

### 🛠️ SQL Concepts Used:
- `JOIN` operations (e.g., rentals + inventory)
- `CASE` statements for performance classification
- Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`)
- Window functions (`RANK() OVER`, `PARTITION BY`)
- Derived columns (e.g., discount %, ROI approximation)

### 📌 Key Queries:
- Revenue vs. Acquisition Cost Analysis
- ROI Tagging (High ROI, Underperforming, Average)
- Category-wise Price and Rating Trends
- Discount Analysis per Product
- Lifecycle stage classification (Introduction → Growth → Mature)
